# DreamMyPlots 🌜✨🖼️

DreamMyPlots is a friendly utitly class for anyone doing data science, who want to turn numbers and data into seaborn/matplot plots quickly, through the power of Python's graph-making skills with any popular LLM prompts (through Langchain)to make even complex charts simple to create.

Here's how you can use it:

1. **Provide Data** 📊: Input your DataFrame and what you'd like to visualize.
2. **AI Assists** 🤖: It then uses AI to generate the Python plotting code based on your prompt.
3. **Visualize** 🌟: Run the generated code to see your data transformed into a visual plot.

And this may:

* **Saves Time** ⏰: No need to write complex code from scratch. It's quicker to get your visuals ready.
* **Boosts Creativity** 🎨: Encourages you to experiment with different types of visuals without the heavy lifting.
* **Simplifies Learning** 📘: Makes it easier to jump into data visualization, even if you're new to data science.
